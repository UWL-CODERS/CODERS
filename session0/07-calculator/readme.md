## Calculator
Practice scanners, variables, printing and if statements here!!<br/>
If you want, change it to doubles! It's double the fun ;)
<br/>
Create a calculator program that asks a user for an integer, an operator, and another integer.
Your program should then do the calculation or comparison, then give the output of that operation.
Example:
````
Please enter an integer: 7
Please enter an operator: +
Please enter an integer: 12
19
```
