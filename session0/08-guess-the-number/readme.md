## Guess the Number
In this program you make a game where you guess a number! The number is randomly generated and stored in the "number" variable.<br/><br/>
Write your code in the method called loop() instead of main(). The code you write will go into a loop until this condition is satisfied: ```
For refrence:
int guess;
int number:

Condition:
(guess == number)
```
Use a scanner to ask what number the player wants to guess.
This should be stored in the "guess" variable.<br/><br/>
Your program should tell the player to guess higher or lower depending on their guess and the number. The program should also give a
hit to the player when they are 5 numbers away. It should say something along the lines of "You are really close!"
<br/><br/>
You can copy and paste in the completed code to see how the program runs.<br/><br/>
The "(input)" means that line is user input.
<br/>
Example output:
```
Guess the number!
40 (input)
Guess higher!
Guess the number!
80 (input)
You are really close!
Guess lower!
Guess the number!
83 (input)

77 (input)

79 (input)

78 (input)
You got it! It took you 6 guesses!
```
