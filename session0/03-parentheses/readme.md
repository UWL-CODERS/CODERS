## Parentheses
This is the order of operations for mathematics.<br/>
1. Parentheses<br/>
2. Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)<br/>
3. Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br/>
4. Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br/>

This goes for your program too when you use arithmetic operators!
